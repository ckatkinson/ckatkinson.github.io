        <p> For the 4.8 discussion problems, you should work in small groups
        (2-3 people sharing a computer). I suggest starting with the
        newtonsmethod.nb notebook linked from the main course webpage. Submit
        one assignment per group by emailing Chris a .nb file containing your
        solutions. Include your names in the email. Use the Cell - Style menu
        and the Text option to insert explanations and your names into your
        notebook.  <br> <br> After completing the discussion problems, work
        together to solve your WeBWorK problems. You'll each have to take a turn
        to get the right numbers for your individualized problems.  </p>
